# PLANS.md

## Purpose

This file is the canonical repo-root execution pointer.

## Active execution control surfaces

The governing canonical gate authority remains:
- `docs/planning/2026-03-24_CANONICAL_VISION_GATE_MAP_v1.md`

The bounded-scope note remains:
- `docs/planning/2026-03-24_CANONICAL_VISION_EXTENSION_EXECUTION_PLAN_v3.md`

The canonical leaf ledger remains:
- `docs/planning/2026-03-24_CANONICAL_VISION_EXTENSION_LEAVES_v3.json`

The sequential execution log remains:
- `docs/planning/2026-03-24_CANONICAL_VISION_EXTENSION_EXECUTION_LOG_v3.md`

The completed successor modification pair that closed Gates 51–58 remains:
- `docs/planning/2026-03-26_COGNITIVE_WORKFLOW_MODIFICATION_GATES_v1.md`
- `docs/planning/2026-03-26_COGNITIVE_WORKFLOW_MODIFICATION_LEAVES_v1.json`

The active successor modification pair from Gate 59 onward is:
- `docs/planning/2026-03-27_COGNITIVE_WORKFLOW_MODIFICATION_GATES_v6.md`
- `docs/planning/2026-03-27_COGNITIVE_WORKFLOW_MODIFICATION_LEAVES_v6.json`

`PLANS.md` remains short. Detailed execution logic lives in the planning files above.

## Binding execution status

- Gates 0–7 — completed baseline on `main`
- Gates 8–23 — complete on `main`
- Gates 24–26 — retired superseded planning placeholders (never leafed on the persisted main branch)
- Gate 27 — planning reset complete on `main`
- Gates 28–34 — complete on `main`
- Gates 35–39 — complete on `main`
- Gate 40 — complete on `main`
- Gates 41–44 — complete on `main`
- Gate 45 — retired placeholder on `main`
- Gates 46–50 — complete on `main`
- Gate 51 — complete on `main`
- Gate 52 — complete on `main`
- Gate 53 — complete on `main`
- Gates 54–55 — complete on `main`
- Gates 56–58 — complete on `main`
- Gates 59–61 — complete on `main`

## Sequential execution rule

Active work proceeds one leaf at a time, one gate at a time, with the execution log carrying the receipts once execution begins.

## Current repo state

The persisted `main` baseline is now closed through Gate 61 and records Gate 7 explicitly as baseline leaf `LEAF-G7-BASELINE`. Gates 46–61 are merged on `main`, which means the repo now has:
- the frozen pre-implementation audit in-repo;
- registry-v2 hierarchy with native family/setup-variant lineage;
- formal close-state to carry-horizon handoff for overnight, weekend, and event carry;
- explicit `session_clock` compatibility over canonical `temporal_state`;
- DMP v2 promoted as the canonical live producer surface;
- DMP v1 retired from live runtime dependency and retained only as archived historical context;
- vocabulary governance aligned to family / setup-variant / execution-expression / horizon ownership plus workflow-routing terms such as Step 0 calendar/horizon and carry handoff;
- Gate 59 doctrine rebase complete on `main`, with the V6 pair now the single active successor authority for Gates 60–79;
- Gate 60 ontology freeze complete on `main`, with typed state-policy authority now fencing lawful mutable surfaces away from prohibited runtime variation;
- Gate 61 non-action/conflict law complete on `main`, with explicit stand-down, conflict, degradation, and override vocabulary exposed to review surfaces;
- the attached `_v4_5` salvage artefacts preserved in-repo under `docs/legacy/` as provenance only.

The next authored gate is Gate 62 in the V6 successor pack. No missing `v4` or `v5` draft is required to execute that stack.
