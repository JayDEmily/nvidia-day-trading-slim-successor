# 2026-03-26 Gate 54 — DMP Binding Surface Decision

Status: complete on `main` once merged

## Objective

Close the DMP ambiguity introduced by having live DMP v1 packets plus secondary DMP v2 upgrade paths in the same repo.

## Outcome

Gate 54 freezes the workflow-modification tranche on **DMP v1 as the canonical live producer surface** while explicitly preserving **DMP v2 as a secondary migration/inspection packet surface**.

## Files landed

- `docs/planning/2026-03-26_DMP_BINDING_SURFACE_DECISION.md`
- `docs/planning/2026-03-24_DMP_V1_SPEC.md`
- `docs/planning/2026-03-24_DMP_V2_NORMATIVE_SPEC.md`
- `tests/test_gate54_dmp_binding_surface.py`

## Validation expectation

- targeted DMP binding tests green
- full matrix green
- planning/control surfaces updated so Gate 54 is recorded complete and Gate 55 becomes active
