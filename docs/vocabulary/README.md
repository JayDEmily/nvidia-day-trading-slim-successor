# Vocabulary Governance

This folder governs canonical repo language after the architecture is pinned.

## What this is for

- keep one term meaning one thing;
- keep aliases explicit rather than accidental;
- stop stale `session_clock`-era labels or duplicate playbook labels from drifting back in;
- preserve the difference between raw primitives, derived features, stage labels, family labels, setup variants, and execution expressions.

## What this is not for

- not a blind merge target for stale harvested vocabulary payloads;
- not a runtime redesign surface;
- not a free-form glossary detached from typed contracts.

## Authoritative artefacts
